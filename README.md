# Fantasy_league
The purpose of this project is to create an anlytics dashboard that can be used to quickly gain insights about your Fantasy Premier League team. Making changes to your team can be annoying and time consuming as you have do look at each individual player's stats and upcoming feature, and compare them to others.

Furthermore, Fantasy League doesn't provide any way to get an overview of your performance (aside from comparing your points to the highest and average points in a specific gameweek). This dashboard solves those problems. It leverages the Fantasy Premier League API endpoints to pull data on managers (i.e.: people who play the game), specific player stats and leagues. The dashboard was made using Dash and below, you can find a sample of what it looks like in Matplotlib:
